# Sammy-Chat-Bot

Sammy is a proof of concept that simulates a bot that could be used for a voice-first shopping experience. It utilizes API.AI and Firebase for the testing/demo purposes.

This project was completed during my 14-week co-op experience at the Sam's Club Home Office in Bentonville, AR.

This project can be ran in any web browser. User authentication works so when an account is created, it is being stored in Firebase.
